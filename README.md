# physlex.github.io
a personal website project to be developed over a long period of time

## NOTICE:
- The website is very much a long-term plan. Dont assume this is all I can do!
It just means that I have only got this far with my first multi-dev-tool project.
- One thing that is especially important, I am 100% web-dev self taught,
and a soon to be student of the University of Alberta. That means I am qualified to learn.
To learn fast, in particular.

## Plans:
- A clock using jscript
- A postgresql database to allow myself to create a blog.
- Primary focus on client-side development to begin with.
- Full test-suite for the python and jscript side of things. 
Not really sure how to test html and css. 
Probably just user testing.
