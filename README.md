## Watch test branch to see what has yet to be tested and passed to main
a personal website project to be developed over a long period of time
***

### NOTICE:
- The website is very much a long-term plan. Dont assume this is all I can do!
It just means that I have only got this far with my first multi-dev-tool project.
- Most of the time, when something is yet to be finished, it means I am testing stuff I have learned 
in class and am finding ways to introduce it to my outside-of-school projects. (like this one)

### Plans:
- A clock using jscript
- Primary focus on client-side development to begin with.
- Full test-suite for the python and jscript side of things.
